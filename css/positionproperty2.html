  <!-- Section 1: Static Position -->
  <!-- This element stays where it normally appears in the flow -->
  <h2>1. Static Position (Default)</h2>
  <div class="box static-box">
    Static Box<br>
    (Stays in normal flow)
  </div>

  <!-- Section 2: Relative Position -->
  <!-- This element moves from its original location without affecting others -->
  <h2>2. Relative Position</h2>
  <div class="box relative-box">
    Relative Box<br>
    (Moved from its normal spot)
  </div>

  <!-- Section 3: Absolute Position -->
  <!-- The container is relative so that the absolute box is placed inside it -->
  <h2>3. Absolute Position (Inside Relative Container)</h2>
  <div class="absolute-container">
    <!-- This box is absolutely positioned 10px from top and left inside the red container -->

<!-- This code demonstrates the CSS position property with examples of static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky positioning. -->
<!-- The boxes are styled with different colors and positions to illustrate how each type behaves in the document flow. -->
<!-- The static box remains in its normal position, the relative box moves from its original spot, the absolute box is positioned within a relative container, the fixed box stays in a fixed position on the screen, and the sticky box sticks to the top when scrolling. -->
<!-- The code includes headings and descriptions for each section to clarify the purpose of each box. -->
<!-- The layout is designed to be simple and easy to understand, making it suitable for learning about CSS positioning. -->
<!-- The example also includes a fixed box that remains in the same position on the screen while scrolling, and a sticky box that sticks to the top of the viewport when scrolled to. -->
<!-- The CSS styles are applied to demonstrate the different positioning methods clearly. -->
